    <h1>Welcome to the NodeJS Documentation </h1>
    <p>
        In this project I will try to answer two questions: What is NodeJS? and how to?
    </p>

        <h3>What is NodeJS?</h3>
        <p>
            Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side application using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Node.js can be used to build different types of applications such as web application, real-time chat application, REST API server and  more. However, it is mainly used to build network programs like web servers, similar to PHP, Java...etc.

        <h3>How to bootstrap NodeJS in an application?</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            
            <ul class="no-bullets">
            I am going to introduce NodeJS with Node Package Module (NPM), step-by-step basic implementation and explanation.
            Here are the procedure to follow in order to bootstrap node.js application:
                <li>Installation of NodeJS and NPM (if not installed already navigate to the official nodejs website referred above)</li>
                <li>Node Package Module (NPM - to initialize your application folder)</li>
                <li>Package.json (defines dependencies, scripts and metadada about the project. It is the heart of any Node project)</li>
            </ul>
            Note: all the above steps are done through the use of command prompt (cli for Windows, Bash for linux and Terminal for Mac). NodeJS is not framework nor a programming language but an 'Environment' for both.
